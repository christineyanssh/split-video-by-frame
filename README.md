# split-video-by-frame
Using OpenCV takes a mp4 video and produces a number of images.


## Requirements

You require OpenCV 3.2 to be installed.

## Run

Open the `main.py` and edit the path to the video. Then run:

```
python main.py
```


Which will produce a folder called `data` with the images.
